# ELF References Specification

This is a specification which defines a framework for adding
[Linked data][ld] references to ELF binaries.  Importantly,
this specification is a work in progress and is subject to
change.

The spec itself may be viewed at [spec.md](spec.md).

A reference implementation is available named [reftool][reftool].
